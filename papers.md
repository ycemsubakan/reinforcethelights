## Deep Reinforcement Learning for Traffic Light Control in Vehicular Networks

### 1. Intro

The policeman in the intersection is replaced by a reinforcement learning algorithm. The policeman is assumed to follow an Markov Decision Process. If I am understanding correctly,  the overall congestion in the streets is represented as a matrix, and somehow we go from this matrix to a set of rewards, which is a function of cumulative waiting times. 

In this paper, the environment is simulated through a simulator called `SUMO`.
